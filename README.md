# Words
Hello, and welcome to my Ted-oh wrong thing.

This is words. Words is the most useless thing I've ever built.

## Why did I make it?
I wanted to learn Tailwind and mess around with Vue 3 so I made something stupid but fun.

## What do you do?
Not much really. Type words in, hit enter or add, they go in the list.

You can type sentences and they get split into words.

If there are duplicates, you can see the count and remove all but the first instance of the word.
